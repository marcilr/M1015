  "One of the most popular SAS 6.0gbps/ SATA III controllers for enthusiasts is the IBM M1015.
  In its native form, it is a very capable host bus adapter (HBA) based on the LSI SAS2008 chip.
  With the low price on places such as ebay (see here for an ebay search for the M1015)[1] and an
  enthusiastic community that has learned to unlock many features, it has quickly become a go-to
  choice for low-cost SATA III connectivity. This series of articles was written by Pieter Schaar
  perhaps best known as the one behind laptopvideo2go.com.[2] He has been a regular contributor
  in the STH forums and has been detailing his learning in threads such as these.  I do want to
  note that these modifications are not endorsed by this site, LSI, IBM or others and the
  information herein is purely for educational purposes. If you do encounter problems, you are
  solely responsible for those consequences."
