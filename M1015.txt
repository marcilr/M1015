IBM M1015


"One of the most popular SAS 6.0gbps/ SATA III controllers for enthusiasts
is the IBM M1015.  In its native form, it is a very capable host bus adapter
(HBA) based on the LSI SAS2008 chip.  With the low price on places such as
ebay (see here for an ebay search for the M1015)[1] and an enthusiastic
community that has learned to unlock many features, it has quickly become a
go-to choice for low-cost SATA III connectivity.  This series of articles was
written by Pieter Schaar perhaps best known as the one behind
laptopvideo2go.com.[2] He has been a regular contributor in the STH forums and
has been detailing his learning in threads such as these.  I do want to note
that these modifications are not endorsed by this site, LSI, IBM or others and

encounter problems, you are solely responsible for those consequences."
